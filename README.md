# CodeJamTeamRepo
This is a repo merely for notes and stuff. This is not the forked repo for the jam. 

The requirements.txt file contains my pip freeze output. 
The .flake8 file would go in the project to make the line length for flake8 match black.

I used venv to create the virtual envoronment. It was run with: 
python3 -m venv venv 

followed by:
source ./venv/bin/activate

I assume: 
python3 -m pip -r requirements.txt

But I am not sure. :)
